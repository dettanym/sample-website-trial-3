Hi there! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I research privacy-enhancing technologies. My supervisor is [Ian Goldberg](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~iang/). I work at the [CrySP (Cryptography, Security and Privacy) lab](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca)!

**Research**: My PhD research topic is operationalizing _data minimization_ for _distributed_ back-end web architectures. I will be building privacy observability and enforcement frameworks for distributed microservices and data architectures.

My [Masters thesis research](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/14765) was focused on ensuring _compliance_ of privacy policies with (monolithic) back-end source code using _trusted hardware platforms_. My other research projects include building a cache-aware interactive differential privacy engine and integrating private information retrieval into censorship-resistant publishing systems. In general, I am interested in designing and implementing tools that help people protect their privacy!

**Teaching**: I am very passionate about teaching at the university level and to underrepresented groups. I have teaching experience as a sessional instructor and a TA for an upper-year undergraduate security and privacy course. I am completing teaching certificates and as a part of these programs, I have engaged in teaching pedagogy research.
